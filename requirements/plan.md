I've reviewed the codebase and here's a detailed plan to implement proper text dragging functionality:
Files Needing Changes:
public/editor.js (main changes)
public/styles.css (minor changes)

Current State Analysis:
The current implementation has basic drag functionality but several issues:
Text position updates aren't smooth
Mouse cursor state management is inconsistent
Hit detection for text selection is imprecise
Drag offset calculation is incorrect
Step-by-Step Implementation Plan:
1. Update Text Overlay Data Structure
In editor.js, enhance the textOverlay object to include:
Bounding box information
Drag state
Mouse offset data
Reference to current line numbers:
overlay
2. Create Text Measurement Utility
Add a new function to accurately calculate text dimensions
Include padding for better hit detection
Consider font metrics and scaling
Add before the existing drawTextOverlay function
3. Enhance Mouse Event Handlers
Replace existing mouse event handlers with improved versions
Add proper cursor state management
Implement smooth position updates
Reference to current handlers:
;
4. Update Text Drawing Function
Modify drawTextOverlay to support:
Visual feedback during dragging
Proper text positioning
Reference to current function:
}
5. Add CSS Styles
In public/styles.css, add:
Cursor styles for draggable text
Hover state indicators
Dragging state visual feedback
Reference to relevant section:
}
6. Implement Text Selection Prevention
Add CSS to prevent text selection during drag
Add JavaScript handlers to manage selection state
7. Add Touch Support
Implement touch event handlers
Ensure smooth operation on mobile devices
Add proper touch feedback
Implementation Notes:
Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth updates
Implement proper cleanup of event listeners
Consider canvas scaling factors
Maintain compatibility with existing image adjustments
Ensure proper state management during drag operations
